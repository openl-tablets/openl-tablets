# Code Owners for OpenL Tablets
#
# This file defines individuals or teams responsible for code in this repository.
# Code owners are automatically requested for review when someone opens a pull request
# that modifies code that they own.
#
# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most precedence.
# More specific patterns should be listed after more general ones.
#
# For more information, see:
# https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners

# Default owners for everything in the repository
