# This workflow will build a Java project with Maven on every push or pull request for quick checking of incoming commits.
# Verifies only on the latest Ubuntu LTS version and JDK 8.
# Checks performance on limited amount of memory to detect extra memory consumption by throwing timeouts and memory errors.
