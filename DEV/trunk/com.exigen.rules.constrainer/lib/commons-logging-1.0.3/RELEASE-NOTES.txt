                           Commons Logging Package
                                Version 1.0.3
                                Release Notes


INTRODUCTION:
============

This document contains the release notes for this version of the Commons
Logging package.  It is primarily a maintenance and code cleanup release,
with minimal new features.

The following paragraphs document changes since the previous release
(version 1.0.2).


NEW FEATURES:
============

[build.xml]        Refined build process to correctly avoid compiling classes
                   when dependencies are not available, and to avoid name
                   clashes over Ant properties used in different ways.

[unit tests]       Added new suites of tests for the Log4J and JDK 1.4
                   logging implementations, including tests with multiple
                   class loaders that closely simulate the scenario of using
                   commons-logging in a servlet container.

[documentation]    Overall cleanup and correction of the JavaDoc documentation
                   to correctly reflect the current behavior.  In particular,
                   the default logging implementation (selected if nothing
                   else is configured) is now SimpleLog, not NoOpLog.

[LogFactory]       Add a static release(ClassLoader) method that allows,
                   for example, a webapp to clean up all c-l references
                   prior to being shut down.

BUG FIXES:
=========

[build.xml]        Correct the META-INF/MANIFEST.MF that was embedded in the
                   generated JAR files to properly contain the version number.

[LogFactory]       Fix security violations on several ClassLoader method
                   invocations.

[SimpleLog]        Dump stack trace through logger, instead of directly to
                   System.out, to preserve output sequence.

[SimpleLog]        Avoid a security exception if system properties cannot be
                   read (such as in an applet).

[Bugzilla 10825]   NullPointerException when Logger.getClassLoader()
                   returns null.

[Bugzilla 13118]   Correct detection of JDK 1.4 that was mis-identifying on a
                   scenario where a JDK 1.3 implementation included an
                   implementation of JSR-47 logging.

[Bugzilla 13157]   Incorrect selection of Log4J in a servlet container.

[Bugzilla 13201]   Log4JLogger should not attempt to auto-configure
                   appenders; this is out of scope for commons-logging.

[Bugzilla 17561]   Attempts to override Log4J configuration.

[Bugzilla 17894]   Unable to configure commons-logging SimpleLog for a webapp.

[Bugzilla 18184]   Jdk14Logger should not waste the effort to create a
                   Throwable (to extract calling class and method) if the
                   message is not going to be logged anyway.


DEPRECATIONS:
============

[LogSource]        Previously deprecated, replaced by LogFactory.

[Log4jFactory]     A proxy instance of this class was transparently created
                   when Log4J logging was selected, yet it serves no useful
                   purpose.  The class is now deprecated, and the proxy
                   instance is no longer created.

[Log4JCategoryLog] This class has been replaced by Log4JLogger, which
                   corresponds to the availability of the new Logger class
                   in Log4J 1.2 and later.
