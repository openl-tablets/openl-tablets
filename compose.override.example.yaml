# Copy this file to compose.override.yaml and add your local changes there.
# compose.override.yaml is in .gitignore and will not be committed.
# Docker Compose automatically merges compose.override.yaml with compose.yaml
# when you run: docker compose up
#
# Example: override a port or environment variable for local development
#
# services:
#   studio:
#     ports:
#       - "9080:8080"
#     environment:
#       _REACT_UI_ROOT_: http://localhost:3100
