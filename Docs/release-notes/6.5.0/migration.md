title: "OpenL Tablets 6.5.0 Migration Notes"
---

Upgrading to OpenL Tablets 6.5.0 requires no database changes and no Java version change. Groovy moves from `4.0.33`
to `6.0.0`, skipping the whole 5.x line. A project that carries Groovy sources needs a source-compatibility check
before the upgrade. Every deployment runs the new Groovy runtime, so the administrator notes below apply even where
no project carries Groovy sources.

## Rules Authors

* **A source-compatibility check is needed only for a project with a `groovy/` folder.** Rules in Excel are not
  compiled by Groovy, so they need no re-save and no re-compile for the language changes below.

* **A static member can no longer be called through a parameterized type.** Groovy 6 rejects what Groovy 4 accepted,
  applying the rule Java has always had:

  ```groovy
  Literal<Node> x = Literal<Node>.of(true)   // no longer compiles
  Literal<Node> x = Literal.of(true)         // write this instead
  ```

  Groovy reports `Cannot refer to a static member of a generic type through a parameterization`. Removing the type
  argument from the call is the whole fix — the variable keeps its declared type and behavior does not change.

* **Recognize the symptom.** A Groovy class that fails to compile surfaces as a missing type rather than as a
  compilation error. The module reports `Cannot load type: <fully qualified class name>`, and a service built from
  that project fails to deploy. Compiling the project's Groovy sources directly against Groovy 6 shows the real
  message.

> [!Note]
> The rule above is the change OpenL's own projects had to adapt to. Groovy 6 carries further changes over the 4.x
> line, and the 5.x line is skipped entirely, so consult the Groovy release notes before upgrading a project that
> leans on less common language features.

## Administrators

* **Groovy 6 requires Java 17 or later**, which OpenL Tablets already exceeds — it requires Java 21. No JDK change
  is needed.

* **Groovy 6 occupies more heap at rest than Groovy 4.** A deployment whose maximum heap is tuned close to its
  previous usage should re-measure before upgrading. For scale: the memory-constrained suite in OpenL's own build
  runs under a 61 MB cap and needed 2 MB more to pass on Groovy 6.

* **`groovy.use.classvalue` is now a mode, not a flag.** Groovy 6 reads `true` (the default) and `soft` as keeping
  the class-metadata cache backed by `java.lang.ClassValue`; any other value selects the map-based cache. Setting it
  to `false` keeps `ClassValue` out of the cache, which is what avoids the classloader pinning behind the metaspace
  leak of GROOVY-12142; the `soft` mode added by GROOVY-12281 keeps `ClassValue` but lets its entries be reclaimed.
  Groovy 5 ignored the property altogether, so a deployment that set it while passing through 5.x on its own should
  confirm the value again.

## Testing Recommendations

After upgrading, verify in a non-production environment:

1. Every project that carries a `groovy/` folder compiles and deploys.
2. A service published from such a project answers as it did before.
3. Heap headroom, if the maximum heap is set close to the previous usage.
