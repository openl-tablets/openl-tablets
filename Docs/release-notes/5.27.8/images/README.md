# Images for OpenL Tablets 5.27.8 Release Notes

Upload screenshots and diagrams to this folder to reference in the release notes.

## Naming Convention
- Use descriptive names: `feature-name.png` not `screenshot1.png`
- Use lowercase with hyphens
- Prefer PNG format for screenshots
- Keep file sizes reasonable (compress if needed)

## Referenced Images

No images are currently referenced in the 5.27.8 release notes. This is a maintenance and security-focused release without major UI features that require screenshots.

If screenshots are added in the future, reference them in `index.md` using the format:
```markdown
![Description](images/image-name.png)
```
