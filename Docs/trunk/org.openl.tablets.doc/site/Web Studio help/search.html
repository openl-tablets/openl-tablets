For example, in the following diagram, the table on the left is a decision table but the table on the right is a unit test table that tests data of the decision table: OpenL Web Studio supports visual controls for creating and running project unit tests. Unit test tables can be modified like all other tables in OpenL Web Studio. For information on modifying a table, see Modifying Tables. Test results are displayed in a simple format directly in the user interface. To run unit tests, the following methods can be used: Methods for running unit tests Method Description Execute all project tests at once System automatically executes all test runs in every unit test in project and displays a summary of results. To run all project tests, in rule editor, above the module tree, click Run All Tests . Test results resemble the following: Failed tests are represented by the mark. Passed tests are represented by the mark. Execute all tests for a single decision table System executes all test runs for one particular decision table.

For information on OpenL Tablets, see OpenL Tablets Reference Guide. Users can modify rules directly in a web browser without installing additional tools by using OpenL Web Studio.

It provides a centralized storage of rule projects called design time repository. Design time repository is stored on the OpenL Web Studio server and can be accessed by all users. However, users cannot modify projects directly in design time repository. Instead, to make modifications to a project, users must execute the following procedure: Procedure for modifying a project Step Action Description 1 Check out a project. Checking out a project from design time repository creates a copy in user&#146;s workspace, a specific location on the OpenL Web Studio server. Working copies of projects checked out by the particular user are stored here. Users can only access their personal workspaces. A checked out project is locked in design time repository to avoid loss of information. Other users cannot check it out until the project is checked in. Other users can only open checked out projects in read only mode. 2 Modify a project. Modifications to a checked out project are performed on the working copy stored in user's workspace. Modifications are not immediately visible to other users. 3 Check in a project. Checking in a project copies user's workspace modified copy to design time repository. A new version of the project is created in design time repository. A project can be restored to any of its previous versions. From this point, changes are visible to other users and the project is available for check out. In addition to checking out and checking in projects, users can also open and close them. An open project is copied from design time repository to user's workspace, but the user cannot modify its contents. If a user only wants to view contents of a project, opening the project is recommended instead of checking it out. A checked out project is locked for editing by other users. Closing a project deletes it from user's workspace but does not affect the version in design time repository. Closed projects can be browsed in repository editor but are not available in rule editor.");var sb=0;var sc=1;var sd=2;var se=3;var sf=4;var sg=5;var sh=6;var si=7;var sj=8;var sk;var sl;var sm;var sn; var s98 ; var sB=true;var sC=1;var sE=2;var sD=3;var sF=4;var sP=false;var sQ=true;var s46=true;var s83=true;var s73=true;var s14=true;var s17=true;var s90=-1;var s45;var sT;function SMPSetFocus() { document.formSearch.txtSearch.focus(); }

<h2>Searching Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To search for all search phrase words, from the drop-down list, select <b>Search 
    for words &quot;as a phrase&quot;.</b> </li>
  <li>To search for any search phrase word, from the drop-down list, select <b>Search 
    for any of the words.</b></li>
  <li>To perform a case sensitive search, select <b>Case Sensitive.</b></li>
  <li>To perform a wildcard search, use the asterisk (*) character. It can only 
    appear at the beginning or end of the search phrase.<br>
    Examples: 
    <ul>
      <li> <b>the*</b> matches the, them, their, themselves </li>
      <li> <b>*ing</b> matches surfing, browsing, searching </li>
      <li> <b>*net*</b> matches network, intranets, internet <br>
