<h1>OpenL Tablets Change Log</h1>

<h2>Version 5.2.0</h2>

This is the major release that introduces 3 new components: Spreadsheet, TBasic and ColumnMatch.
<p>
Spreadsheet provides capabilities similar to one can find in the standard Excel to provide
complex interdependent calculations. As always, OpenL Tablets component comes fully integrated with other
components and provides excellent compile and runtime diagnostics, encapsulation and superior performance.
<p>
ColumnMatch is a specialized component providing advanced score card functionality
<p>
TBasic (a.k.a. Table Basic) component gives business users a simple, structured and familiar language to define
sequential algorithms. While OpenL Tablets comes fully equipped with Java-based org.openl.java programming language,
the practice has shown that that it is more convenient for developers who find themselves in a familiar
language environment. Nevertheless, our business users expressed the desire to have a simple but powerful
language to program complex algorithmic logic. TBasic is an answer to this request, as you already guessed 
it is modeled after VB, and contains a lot of familiar operators as IF-THEN-ELSE, WHILE, SET etc.  

Other changes as always contain different improvements and bug fixes. 
 

<h2>Version 5.1.1</h2>

This release contains several new features, improvements in the build process
and, as always, bug fixes. 

<p>
<b>IMPORTANT NOTE. </b> Due to the change in the Rules Repository Schema, you would have to scrap 
the old version of the repository. Don't forget to save your rules somewhere else before doing this.

<p>

<h3>The Formal Introduction of the OpenL Constrainer</h3>

While Constrainer have been a part of the OpenL Tablets distribution for a while, now is a good time
to introduce it formally. This is an exciting piece of the technology that definitely deserves it's own project, 
but we have made the decision to keep it under OpenL Tablets umbrella. There are a few reasons for this

<li>OpenL Constrainer is the main technology behind our <i>almost patented</i> 
Decision Table Consistency Checking algorithm (see below)   

<li>Reversely, the Constrainer benefits from other OpenL technologies, for example, mathematical constraints formulas look nicer with 
operator overloading, logical problems often look better in the table form, as our new Tutorial 6 conspicuously called Sudoku Puzzle may demonstrate
  


<h3>New Features</h3>

<li>Decision Table Consistency Checking for under-coverage and overlapping between rules
<li>OpenL Repository now supports user-defined tags


<h3>Improvements</h3>

<li>OpenL language now supports BigDecimal and BigInteger arithmetic
<li>Build process have been streamlined to work with Maven2
<li>Data Tables now allow to enter the Fake Primary Key for the types that do not have a primary key field. 

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

<p>
In this release a lot of efforts have been spent on streamlining build process, improving compatibility with
other products and platforms etc. Therefore most fixed bugs and issues had internal nature. 
<p>
Here are a couple of bugs that may be of interest to users:


<li><b>JIRA-257</b> Firefox 3 inserts an extra wrong symbol in Table Editor
<li><b>JIRA-339</b> Bug in Decision Table in formulas like '=1


<p>

For more details on new features and improvements see documentation

<p>


<h2>Version 5.0.6</h2>

This is mostly a maintenance release with several bugs fixed

<p>Most important bug fixes:

<li>Saving non-string cells in Table Editor caused formatting issues
<li>Repository and Web Service deployment demo documented and configuration issues fixed
<li>Optimized decision tables had problems when variable names were misspelled (wrong case) 


<h2>Version 5.0.5</h2>

<h3>New Functionality</h3>

<li><a href="rb-overview.shtml">JCR-based Repository</a>
<li>AJAX-based Table Editor
<li>Vocabulary
<li><a href="bex505.shtml">Business Expression Language(BEX)</a>
<li>Using Java Proxy to wrap OpenL Module   

<h3>Major Bug Fixes</h3>

<li>Using OpenL Wrapper in multi-threaded environment - create local copy of RuntimeEnv
<li>Adding operators to handle long arithmetic


<h2>Version 4.1.1 Build 7</h2>

<h3>Performance Optimization</h3>
<p>
Decision Tables performance has been improved. Indexing has been provided for certain types of conditions resulting in significant performance 
improvements, especially for the large tables.

<h3>Benchmarks</h3>
<p>
Interactive Benchmarks have been added for all methods. User can run and compare benchmarks.
Added Tutorial 5 with Performance and Benchmarks examples



<h3>Web Studio Start Screen Customization</h3>
<p>
Simple customizations can be applied to Web Studio start screen. Now you can impress your boss and your clients
with custom look and feel by defining the following System Properties:
<li><code>-Dorg.openl.webstudio.header.image</code> - for header image file
<li><code>-Dorg.openl.webstudio.intro.html</code> - for right frame initial html or jsp file 
<li><code>-Dorg.openl.webstudio.tree.bcgr</code> - for project tree background color 




<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<p>
Fixed new "Simple OpenL Tablets Project" template. It contained an obsolete reference. The problem could be fixed by running "Generate Wrapper..." script in Eclipse. 

<h2>Version 4.0.1 Build 14</h2>


<h3>Project Display Name</h3>
<p>
To change the display name of the OpenL Tablets project go to 
build/GenerateJavaWrapper.build.xml and change the property "displayName". 
Then run "Generate ... Wrapper" command from Eclipse Run menu and refresh 
the project in Eclipse. If WebStudio is open, refresh the project in WebStudio 



<h3>Business View and Developer View</h3>
<p>
To address the important issue of having business people involved
at the early stages of the project development when business-friendly UI
have not been developed yet, Web Studio now provides <a href="ws-modes.shtml">two display modes</a>:
Business and Developer. It defaults to the Business Mode. 

<p>To switch between modes click on "Web Studio" text on the Top Menu.

<p>Developer Mode is more or less "show all" mode.


<h3>New Functionality in Web Studio</h3>
 
<li><a href="ws-unit-tests401.shtml">Unit Tests</a> 
<li>Run 
<li>Trace 
<li>Explanation
<li>Advanced Search
 
 
 
 
<h3>Improved look of Excel tables in Web Browser</h3>

<p>
Web Studio now displays Excel tables using Excel formats for numbers, dates and borders. There are still some
compatibility issues due to the fact tha Excel and Html are not 100% compatible, but for the most commonly used Excel
formats the results will be very close

<h3>Session Timeout</h3>
<p>
Tomcat default timeout is set for 30 min in conf/web.xml. 
After a timeout Web Studio will display message and restart web application.  


<h3>OpenL Changes</h3>

<p>
The only change worth mentioning  was the change of in semantics of the <b>== operator</b> for Strings. Now
it is different from standard Java semantics - it still works with nulls, but if both operands are not null it
uses <code>equals()</code> for comparison. If this change is accepted by the OpenL community, we are going to 
expand this semantic change to Dates and other quasi-primitive types. 



<h2>Version 3.1.0.7 Build 20</h2>

<li>Build 20 contains some minor changes that were required for <a href="webstudio.shtml">Web Studio</a> introduction</li>
<li>Web Studio prototype is available. <a href="ws/html/ws-install.shtml">Installation</a></li>

<li>Updated documentation, added Web Studio <a href="ws/html/ws-intro.shtml">simple manual</a> and <a href="webstudio.shtml">screenshots</a></li>
<p>
Code changes
<li>OpenL Version and Build are now programmatically available using 
   <code>org.openl.main.OpenLVersion.getVersion()</code>
   and <code>org.openl.main.OpenLVersion.getBuild()</code> methods. Main modules now display version and build when start. 
   It will become handy when (if?) people start coming with support requests. <br/>
   <i>Nobody came so far. I still wonder is it a good sign?</i>  
</li>

<li>Fixed problem with empty nodes in Indexer, they were inadvertently inserted there after failed search</li>

<li>	Emergency fix for missed re-export of org.apache.ant plugin</li>


<h2>Version 3.1.0.7 Build 18</h2>

<li>	Cleaned up build, removed unnecessary jars</li>
<li>	Removed obsolete Configuration Project</li>
<li>	DT API now reflects more structural information (was required for the converter)</li>

<h2>Version 3.1.0.7 Build 16</h2>

<li>	Added Tutorial 3 - Advanced Data and Decision Tables</li>
<li>	Added OpenL Tablets Deployment.htm</li>


<h2>Version 3.1.0.7 Build 15</h2>

<li>	Added Data arrays of primitive types</li>
<li>	Added Tutorial 2 - Intro to Data Tables</li>
<li>	Fixed few problems, most important - "for" loop error</li>
 



<h2>Version 3.1.0.7 vs 3.1.0.6</h2>


<h3>Configuration</h3>

<li>	Ant-based and property-based configuration now 100% optional. All configuration can be done through Java classes + import statements within spreadsheets</li>
<li>	There is no need to install lang.config project</li>
<li>	There is no need for org.openl.rules.java.ant.properties file</li>
<li>	Environment Table has new field "import". It is responsible for all the package imports. This is to be used instead of .properties file </li>
<li>	The name of language configuration is by default "org.openl.rules.java". Therefore field language is now optional.</li>



<h3>Functionality Upgrade</h3>


<li>	Decision Tables now support other return types than void. This is done by using new RET(return) columns. They work like regular actions with only exception: once RET action is executed, the result of action is immediately(!) returned as return value of Decision Table method. This feature is very useful for all Decision Table with lookup-like functionality. The type of RET column(s) must be compatible with return type of Decision Table Method Header. </li>
