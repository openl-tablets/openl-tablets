### Installing OpenL Tablets

OpenL Tablets installation instructions are provided in [OpenL Tablets Installation Guide > Deploying OpenL Studio](https://openldocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/documentation/guides/installation_guide/#deploying-openl-tablets-webstudio).
The development environment is required only for creating OpenL Tablets projects and launching OpenL Studio or OpenL Rule Services. If OpenL Tablets projects are accessed through OpenL Studio or web services, no specific software needs to be installed.
