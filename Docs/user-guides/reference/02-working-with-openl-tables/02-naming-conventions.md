### Naming Conventions

The following conventions apply to the rule, field, and function names:

-   The first character of the name must be **Java letter,** that is, a Unicode character, underscore, or dollar sign.
-   The name must consist of Java letters and Java digits.

A **Java digit** is a collection of numbers from 0 to 9.
