#### Default Value

Some properties can have default values. A **default value** is a predefined value that can be changed only in the OpenL Tablets configuration. The default value is used if no property value is defined in the rule table or in the **Properties** table.

Properties defined by default are not added to the table's properties section and can only be changed in the **Properties** pane on the right side of OpenL Studio Rules Editor.
