<h1>Roadmap into the Future</h1>

<p>
So, what's next?
<p>
Even though the OpenL Tablets has already become the best thing that happened 
to the programming since the making of the operator GOTO illegal, we are not going to stop here.
Make no mistake: after some cleaning up and catching breath related to the 4.0.1 release, we are going to relentlessly 
pursue new shining tops in the table-based and more general-purpose programming. To give you 
an idea of which particular tops we have in mind, we have compiled the following roadmap 
(it does not include regular enhancement and maintenance, 
only the advanced and <i>new</i> features):

<p>
<ul>
<li>Making tables editable in the Web Browser. This part is crucial to make the Web Studio server-based. 
The Web-based editing will provide us with the following benefits:

<ul>
	<p><li>controlled access to the project's components; essential to the shared access and security

	<p><li>custom validation domains - at the editing time; Excel is a nice table editor, but having custom validations 
	require some really weird body movements and the real-time synchronization with the domains defined in other sources 
	(UML Model, Database etc) can be a real pain; the web-based editing together with domain-enhanced OpenL Core will 
	take care of this problem

	<p><li>better, template-based component creation; less time and effort spent on the custom formatting, just choose one of the pre-defined 
	format pattern or even create the custom ones

</ul>

<p><li> 
Integration with a repository; provide visual structured diff for Excel, Word and probably some other document formats



<p><li>
Custom table validation for Decision and Data tables; not only the single cell validation can be based on the domains, but also 
aggregate table validations like Overlapping or Undercoverage. 

<p><li>Better integration for the custom formulas; currently, if you want to have custom formula types in your Data or Decision Tables, 
you have to capture it as a String type and then use OpenL Java API (quite simple, but still Java API) to do custom compilations 
and other checks. It works, but it will be better to integrate these checks with the general OpenL validation/compilation cycle 

<p><li>New pre-defined table types, promised a long time ago, in particular Lookup and FSM tables


<p><li>Integrated Benchmarking

<p><li>OpenL Domains integration with advanced constraint programming, Semantic Web and other exciting topics

<p><li>Perfecting "business pseudo-natural language" to allow something like this: <i>less than $10M unless in CA</i>. I do believe, 
that allowing the statements like this can do more harm than good in the long run, but people seem to like it, or at least the 
idea of being able to write this way. What the hell, we can do it.
