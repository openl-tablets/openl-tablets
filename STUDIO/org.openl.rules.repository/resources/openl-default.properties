### JAR local repository. It resembles the repo-zip repository but it scans the classpath to find OpenL Tablets projects.

# It determines an archive as a zipped OpenL Tablets project by the following files in the root of the archive:
# * rules.xml
# * deployment.xml
# * deployment.yaml
# Alternatively, it verifies whether archives are located in the /openl/*.zip folder.
