Deployment projects provide the means for tracking the deployment
history of project versions.
OpenL Web Studio provides functionality for quickly opening the deployed project
versions. This is especially useful when some time has passed since
deployment and a review of files during specific deployments is
desired.
    </p>
 

    <p class="MsoBodyText">
To open the specific project versions included in a deployment, proceed
as
follows:
    </p>
 

    <ol type="1">
      <li value="1">

        <p>
In the project tree, select the deployment project.
        </p>

      </li>
      <li value="2">

        <p>
In the right pane, select the <b>Descriptors</b> tab.
        </p>

      </li>
      <li value="3">

        <p>
In the <b>Selected</b> column, select the check boxes for projects to be opened.
        </p>

      </li>
      <li value="4">

        <p>
