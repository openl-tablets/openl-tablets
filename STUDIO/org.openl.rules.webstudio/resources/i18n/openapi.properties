  * No further loading needed
trace.field.node.extra-classes.desc = Space-separated CSS class names for UI styling.\n\
  \n\

  * Node execution failed or threw an exception\n\
  \n\
  When `false`:\n\
  * Node executed successfully
trace.field.node.parameters.desc = List of input parameters passed to the method or rule.\n\
  \n\
  Each parameter includes:\n\
  * Parameter name and description\n\
  * JSON value (or lazy-load reference)\n\
  * JSON Schema for UI rendering\n\
  \n\
  **Note:** Only included in detailed node view (GET `/trace/nodes/{nodeId}`).
trace.field.node.context.desc = Runtime context active during method execution.\n\
  \n\
  Contains environment variables such as:\n\
  * Current date/time\n\
  * Line of business (LOB)\n\
  * User location\n\
  * Other runtime configuration\n\

  \n\
  **Note:** Only included in detailed node view (GET `/trace/nodes/{nodeId}`).
trace.field.node.errors.desc = List of error messages that occurred during node execution.\n\
  \n\
  Each error includes:\n\
  * Error message\n\
  * Error severity (ERROR, WARN, INFO)\n\
  * Stack trace (if available)\n\
  \n\
  **Note:** Only included in detailed node view (GET `/trace/nodes/{nodeId}`) and only when `error=true`.

trace.field.param.name.desc = Parameter name (e.g., `driver`, `vehicle`, `policy`).

trace.field.param.lazy.desc = Indicates whether the parameter value is lazy-loaded.\n\
  \n\
  When `true`:\n\

  * `parameterId` is null
trace.field.param.parameter-id.desc = Unique identifier for lazy-loaded parameter.\n\
  \n\
  Only present when `lazy=true`. Use this ID with GET `/trace/parameters/{parameterId}` to fetch the full parameter value.
trace.field.param.value.desc = JSON representation of the parameter value.\n\
  \n\
  * Null when `lazy=true` (use `parameterId` to fetch)\n\
  * Contains the actual JSON value when `lazy=false`\n\
  * Type varies based on the parameter (object, array, primitive, etc.)
trace.field.param.schema.desc = JSON Schema describing the structure of the parameter value.\n\
  \n\
  Used by UI components to:\n\
