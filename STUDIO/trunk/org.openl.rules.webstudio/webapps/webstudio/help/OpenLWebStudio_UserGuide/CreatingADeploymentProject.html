Deployment to production time repository is performed by using
deployment projects. A deployment project is a list of rule projects and
specific project versions to be deployed together to production time
repository. Deployment projects are useful for recording the history of
project
deployments.
    </p>
 

    <p class="MsoBodyText">
Deployment projects are listed in the project tree, in the <b>Deployment Projects</b> category. Just like rule projects, deployment projects are stored in
design time repository and can be
versioned.
    </p>
 

    <p class="MsoBodyText">
