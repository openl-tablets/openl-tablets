A configuration table is identified by the keyword **Environment** in the first row. No additional parameters are required. Starting with the second row, a configuration table must have two columns. The first column contains commands, and the second column contains input strings for commands.

The following commands are supported in configuration tables:

| Command      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| `dependency` | Adds a dependency module by its name. All data from that module becomes accessible in the current module. <br/>A dependency module can be located in the current project or its dependency projects. In simple words, this is how modules, <br/>often represented by Excel files, ‘communicate’ with each other if tables are split into different modules. |
| `import`     | Imports the specified Java package, class, or library so that its objects and methods can be used in tables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
