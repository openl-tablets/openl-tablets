            OpenL Tablets Demo contains ready to be used OpenL Tablets business rules management system. You can create
            and manage your business rules, deploy them in one click and these rules will be ready to be consumed by any
            application. <br/> <br/>
            For quick start several rule projects are already loaded and opened in WebStudio. Both WebStudio and Web
            Services applications are configured to allow rules deployment. Our example project "Example 3 - Auto Policy
            Calculation" is deployed and running in Web Services application.
