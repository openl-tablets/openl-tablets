# OpenL Tablets MCP Server - Spec Kit

This directory contains [GitHub Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) artifacts for the OpenL Tablets MCP Server. Spec Kit implements "Spec-Driven Development" - a methodology where specifications become executable and directly generate working implementations.

## What is Spec Kit?

Spec Kit is a toolkit that helps AI coding agents understand projects through structured documentation. It consists of four core artifacts that guide development:

1. **Constitution** - Governing principles and development guidelines
2. **Specification** - Functional requirements describing what to build
3. **Implementation Plan** - Technical architecture and tech stack choices
4. **Task List** - Actionable breakdown of work items

## Project Status

**Current Version**: 2.0.0
**Status**: Production Ready (v2.0.0 refactoring complete, test coverage expansion in progress)
**Last Updated**: 2025-11-16

## Artifacts

## Using Spec Kit with AI Agents

### Claude Code

**Referencing artifacts**:
```
"Review the constitution for code style guidelines"
"Check the specification for tool requirements"
"What does the implementation plan say about authentication?"
"Show me the next P0 task from the task list"
```

**When making changes**:
```
"Add a new tool following the constitution and implementation plan"
"Implement T-001 from the task list"
"Update the specification to include the new requirement"
"Check if this change complies with the constitution"
```

### GitHub Copilot / Cursor / Windsurf

1. Open the relevant Spec Kit artifact
2. Use it as context when writing code
3. Reference specific sections in comments:
   ```typescript
   // Implements FR-7: Authentication Management (see specification.md)
   // Follows Security First principle (see constitution.md)
   ```

### Slash Commands (if Spec Kit CLI installed)

```bash
/speckit.constitution  # View governing principles
/speckit.specification # View functional requirements
/speckit.plan          # View implementation plan
/speckit.tasks         # View actionable work items
```

## Workflow Examples

### Adding a New Tool

1. **Constitution**: Check development guidelines and extension pattern
2. **Specification**: Verify the tool fits the project scope
3. **Implementation Plan**: Follow the 5-step tool addition process
4. **Task List**: Check if there's already a related task

**Steps**:
```
1. Review constitution.md → Development Guidelines → Extension Pattern
2. Check specification.md → Ensure new tool aligns with core capabilities
3. Follow implementation-plan.md → Implementation Details → Adding Tools
4. Update task-list.md → Add new task if not exists
5. Implement following all guidelines
```

### Improving Test Coverage

1. **Task List**: Find test coverage tasks (T-001 through T-007)
2. **Constitution**: Review testing requirements
3. **Specification**: Understand what needs to be tested
4. **Implementation Plan**: See where tests should be added

**Steps**:
```
1. Check task-list.md → Find T-001 (auth.ts tests)
2. Review constitution.md → Testing Requirements → Coverage targets
3. Read specification.md → FR-2: Input Validation → What to validate
4. Follow implementation-plan.md → Testing → Test structure
5. Write tests
```

### Debugging an Issue

1. **Implementation Plan**: Understand architecture and data flow
2. **Specification**: Verify expected behavior
3. **Constitution**: Check if error handling follows guidelines

**Steps**:
```
1. Read implementation-plan.md → Data Flow → Tool Execution Flow
2. Check specification.md → FR-3: Error Handling → Expected errors
3. Verify constitution.md → Error Handling Consistency → Pattern
4. Fix issue following guidelines
```

### Planning a Sprint

1. **Task List**: Review active tasks and priorities
2. **Constitution**: Understand quality gates
3. **Specification**: Know success criteria

**Steps**:
```
1. Review task-list.md → Sprint Planning → Sprint 1-5
2. Select tasks based on priority (P0 → P1 → P2)
3. Check constitution.md → Quality Gates → Pre-PR requirements
4. Verify specification.md → Success Criteria
5. Execute sprint
```

- `tests/` = VERIFICATION (tests)
- `*.md` (root) = USER DOCUMENTATION (docs)

## Maintaining Spec Kit Artifacts

### When to Update

**Constitution** - Rarely (core principles are stable)
- When adding new development guidelines
- When establishing new quality gates
- When modifying non-negotiables

**Specification** - Occasionally (when requirements change)
- When adding new tools or features
- When changing functional requirements
- When updating success criteria

**Implementation Plan** - Occasionally (when architecture changes)
- When changing technology stack
- When refactoring major systems
- When adding new subsystems

**Task List** - Frequently (ongoing work tracking)
- When completing tasks (mark done)
- When adding new work items
- When re-prioritizing
- During sprint planning

### Update Process

1. **Make code changes**
2. **Update relevant Spec Kit artifacts**
3. **Commit both together**
4. **Keep artifacts in sync with code**

**Example commit**:
```
feat(auth): add SAML authentication support

- Implement SAML auth in auth.ts
- Update specification.md to document new auth method
- Update implementation-plan.md with SAML flow
- Add T-026 to task-list.md for testing
```
